## Why is it ?

I wanted to improve my React Hook knowledge toolbox and this project seemed like the one to do this.

## Challenges

Wanted to somehow make this feel more of an app, so my UX and UI was what made me go back and forth.


## Technologies used

React, SASS, Bootstrap.
Hooks used useContext, useState, useEffect.

## Installation 

To get this running you need to run npm install and after the installation is complete to run npm start.
