Project title SpceX-Rocket-Launches

This WebApp was created to keep track of all of the SpaceX Rokets that are being launched in a modern UI.

Motivation This came up as a challange. It's the first time i am using React and i thought using it in a fun little project like this would make a lot of sense.

Screenshots:

Built with React JS, SCSS
